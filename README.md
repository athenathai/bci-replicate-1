This project was created with the intention of learning how to EEG data and turn it into commands for a computer. I used the Muse 2 headband to play the Chrome dino game, with the command action being blinking to make the dino jump. The volume file follows the same concept, this time using blinking and clenching of the jaw to adjust computer volume.
